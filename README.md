# üóÇÔ∏è Kanban Board App with JWT Authentication

Welcome! This is a full-stack Kanban board application where users can log in securely, manage their tasks, and stay organized using a simple and clean drag-and-drop interface. Built with React, Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, this project adds user authentication with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to keep your data private and secure.

---

## üí° What This Is

This is a fully functional Kanban board that requires users to log in before accessing any tasks. JWTs handle the authentication part, meaning once you're logged in, your session is verified with a secure token. If you're not logged in (or your token expires), you're sent right back to the login page‚Äîno peeking allowed!

You can:
- Sign in securely
- View tasks grouped by status (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Log out and end your session
- Automatically get logged out if you're inactive for a while

This project is built as part of a challenge to enhance an existing Kanban board app by adding secure authentication and deploying it online for real-world access.
